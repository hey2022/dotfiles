#+title: DOOM Emacs Config
#+author: Yiheng He

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets. It is optional.
;; (setq user-full-name "John Doe"
;;       user-mail-address "john@doe.com")



;; Whenever you reconfigure a package, make sure to wrap your config in an
;; `after!' block, otherwise Doom's defaults may override your settings. E.g.
;;
;;   (after! PACKAGE
;;     (setq x y))
;;
;; The exceptions to this rule:
;;
;;   - Setting file/directory variables (like `org-directory')
;;   - Setting variables which explicitly tell you to set them before their
;;     package is loaded (see 'C-h v VARIABLE' to look up their documentation).
;;   - Setting doom variables (which start with 'doom-' or '+').
;;
;; Here are some additional functions/macros that will help you configure Doom.
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;; Alternatively, use `C-h o' to look up a symbol (functions, variables, faces,
;; etc).
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

* UI
** Font
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom:
;;
;; - `doom-font' -- the primary font to use
;; - `doom-variable-pitch-font' -- a non-monospace font (where applicable)
;; - `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;; - `doom-unicode-font' -- for unicode glyphs
;; - `doom-serif-font' -- for the `fixed-pitch-serif' face
;;
;; See 'C-h v doom-font' for documentation and more examples of what they
;; accept. For example:
;;
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Sans" :size 13))
;;
;; If you or Emacs can't find your font, use 'M-x describe-font' to look them
;; up, `M-x eval-region' to execute elisp code, and 'M-x doom/reload-font' to
;; refresh your font settings. If Emacs still can't find your font, it likely
;; wasn't installed correctly. Font issues are rarely Doom issues!

** Theme
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'catppuccin)
#+end_src
** Line numbers
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type `relative)
#+end_src


* Org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/org/")
(setq org-agenda-files '("/home/yiheng/org/agenda.org" "~/school/school.org"))
#+end_src

** Org Roam
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! websocket
  :after org-roam)

(use-package! org-roam-ui
  :after org-roam ;; or :after org
  ;;         normally we'd recommend hooking orui after org-roam, but since org-roam does not have
  ;;         a hookable mode anymore, you're advised to pick something yourself
  ;;         if you don't care about startup time, use
  ;;  :hook (after-init . org-roam-ui-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-roam-ui-sync-theme t
        org-roam-ui-follow t
        org-roam-ui-update-on-save t
        org-roam-ui-open-on-start t))
#+end_src

** Org Auto Export
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun async-org-latex-export-to-pdf ()
  (org-latex-export-to-pdf t))

(defun toggle-pdf-export-on-save ()
  "Enable or disable export PDF when saving current buffer."
  (interactive)
  (when (not (eq major-mode 'org-mode))
    (error "Not an org-mode file!"))
  (if (memq 'async-org-latex-export-to-pdf after-save-hook)
      (progn (remove-hook 'after-save-hook 'async-org-latex-export-to-pdf t)
             (message "Disabled org pdf export on save"))
    (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'async-org-latex-export-to-pdf nil t)
    (message "Enabled org pdf export on save")))
